# Palm Oil Fresh Fruit Bunch (TBS) Prices Forecasting in West Kalimantan Province Using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Method

## Project Overview
This Bachelor's thesis focuses on the comparative analysis of **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** models for **Fresh Fruit Bunch (TBS)** price prediction. The research entails exploring various model architectures, including:
- **Vanilla**
- **Stacked**
- **Bi-directional**
- **Stacked Bi-directional**

These architectures are used to forecast **Fresh Fruit Bunch (TBS)** prices accurately.
